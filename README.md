# Swan Project

## Objective
Create a classification model to predict customer churn rate for a technology company using information about the services each customer is using and characteristics of customers. A list of churn probabilites for each customer, with a separate list of the top 500 customers most likely to churn. A goal was to find insights into how different featues in the dataset are related, and how this could lead to customers churning.

## Result
A Random Forest classifier was used to calculate probabilites of customer churn rate, which had an over 80% accuracy rate. Lists of customers were producted and additional insights gathered and visualised in the Information Deck. Some of the key findings include: online security and tech support decreasing churn rate (increasing likelihood of a customer staying), longer contracts and tenure months increasing likelihood to stay.
